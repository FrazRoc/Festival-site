Ideas for this project

- A place to compile all music stats from APIs around the internet
	1. Setlist.fm
	2. Last.fm
	3. iTunes?
	4. Spotify
	5. Grooveshark
	6. BandsInTown
	7. Rdio

- Create a login to this site
	- Create a user name/ password
	- Log into as many other APIs as you want. 
		- How do we store passwords or tokens?

- Compile this information together
	- Last.fm to show music history
	- Setlist.fm to show concerts attended
	- Somehow keep track of who you saw the show with
		- links to their user profiles
	- show a timeline with all this info compiled on it



Questions:

1. How can we determine what genre artists are in?
2. Do we need a backend?
3. Could we use Node to push updates to the page?
4. What are we using for a datastore
