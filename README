Ideas for this project

- A place to compile all music stats from APIs around the internet
	1. Setlist.fm
	2. Last.fm
	3. iTunes?
	4. Spotify
	5. Grooveshark
	6. BandsInTown
	7. Rdio

- Create a login to this site
	- Create a user name/ password
	- Log into as many other APIs as you want. 
		- How do we store passwords or tokens?

- Compile this information together
	- Last.fm to show music history
		-http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getrecenttracks&user=frazroc&api_key=bd9844981c1afbab9b83da62a89604e3&format=json
	- Setlist.fm to show concerts attended
	- Somehow keep track of who you saw the show with
		- links to their user profiles
	- show a timeline with all this info compiled on it
		-highcharts?
			- get tracks from last fm and graph them 
			- add events from setlist
			- get tag listing (genres) from the artists
				- add colors


Questions:

1. How can we determine what genre artists are in?
2. Do we need a backend?
3. Could we use Node to push updates to the page?
4. What are we using for a datastore
